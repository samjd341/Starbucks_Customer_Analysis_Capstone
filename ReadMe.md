### Starbucks Customer Analysis - Capstone Project

## Project Summary

This project is created for the purpose of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree capstone project. The data is provided by Udacity, and covers a simulation of offers for different customers at Starbucks. In this project we create a clustering model to segment the customers into groups. We then create a model to predict whether an offer is going to be succesesful. 

## Requirements

* Python 3.11+ 
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Json
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Datetime
* Time


## File Descriptions
* profile.json - json file containing customer data
* portfolio.json - json file containing data on offers during the test period
* transcript_part1.json - json file containing data on the events (transactions, offers received, offers viewed and offers completed) during the test. This file contains the first half of the transcript data.
* transcript_part2.json - json file containing data on events (transactions, offers received, offers viewed and offers completed) during the test. This file contains the second half of the transcript data.

* analysis/Starbucks_capstone_notebook.ipynb - python file containing analysis of the starbucks offer data

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis shows that we can create a customer segmentation model, segmenting the customers into 6 different segments. 

We then create a predictive model with an accuracy of %.
